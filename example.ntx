# Sample natrix source code

# Currently, natrix only tokenizes the input
# All tokens are printed to the standard output

    # the following line produces an INDENT token
    (20 - 3) * 6  # comments are considered a part of the NEWLINE token
            # indentation of empty lines is ignored
  # invalid indentation is ignored on empty lines
        4 # another INDENT token on this line
# the following line produces two DEDENT tokens
