# Sample natrix source code

# Currently, natrix programs are sequences of assignments and simple expressions, one per line, with no leading whitespaces
# See doc/grammar.md

# Assignments are evaluated, but their results are not printed
# Expressions are evaluated and their results are printed to the standard output
# Variable `arg` contains the value of the first command line argument, or 0 if there are no arguments

a = 17 - arg
b = (arg + 1) * 50
b / 2 + a
